# About Me

<p align="justify">With 3 years of professional experience honing my skills in client communication, requirement gathering, and overall business conduct, I am currently pursuing Master's in Data Science at Northeastern University, Boston with concurrent professional experience as a Product Analyst Co-op at Homesite Insurance within the American Family Insurance group. My passion for data science, analysis, and visualization drives me to craft compelling narratives through data exploration and my curiosity extends to Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I seek opportunities within organizations that not only leverage my existing knowledge but also foster my growth by embracing new technologies and contributing to their continued success. </p>

## Recent Projects
### [Counting Blood cells and WBC type Prediction](https://github.com/Kunal18/Blood-Cell-Detection){:target="_blank"}

<p align="justify">- Trained the YOLOv5 model on blood cell images, augmenting the dataset to identify the bounding boxes of RBCs, WBCs, and platelets, and achieving a mAP of 92.6% within 100 epochs of training.</p>
<p align="justify">
- Classified WBC cell type using transfer learning using the Inception model, with an accuracy of 99.15%, followed by ResNet-50 (96.08%), and developed a custom CNN architecture with an accuracy of 98.34% despite having fewer parameters.</p>

### [Trending YouTube Video Statistics using sentiment analysis](https://github.com/Kunal18/Youtube_Statistics#youtubestatistics_sml){:target="_blank"}

<p align="justify">
- Generated robust insights into the factors that influence video trending by creating additional features, determined the sentiments for titles, comments, and descriptions using hugging face transformer, and predicted categories of unlabeled videos using random forest algorithm with an F1 score of 95%.</p>
<p align="justify">
- Created a Rshiny application for filtering video searches based on various parameters enhancing userâ€™s ability to browse content.</p>

## Publication
### Depression Detection System by Analyzing Tweets
[Publication](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3358809){:target="_blank"}
<p align="justify">
Developed a system that uses the Twitter API to scrape the real-time tweets, classified the tweets employing a Hybrid Naive Bayes and SVM (NB-SVM) model and used data visualization methodologies to classify depression into two major categories - Major depression and Bipolar depression with an F1 score of 85%.
